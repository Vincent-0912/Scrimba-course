                                    <p>Chameleons or chamaeleons <span>(family Chamaeleonidae)</span> are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards with 202 species described as of June 2015. These species come in a range of colours, and many species have the ability to change colour.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Chameleons are distinguished by their <span>zygodactylous feet</span>, their swaying gait, and crests or horns on their brow and snout. Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail. Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, but in aiming at a prey item, they focus forward in coordination, affording the animal <span>stereoscopic vision</span>.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Chameleons are adapted for climbing and visual hunting. They live in warm habitats that range from <span>rainforest to desert conditions</span>, with various species occurring in Africa, Madagascar, southern Europe, and across southern Asia as far as Sri Lanka. They have been introduced to Hawaii, California, and Florida.</p>

                                    <p>Some chameleon species are able to change their <span>skin coloration</span>. Different chameleon species are able to vary their coloration and pattern through combinations of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light blue, yellow, turquoise, and purple.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Colour change in chameleons has functions in camouflage, but most commonly in social signaling and in reactions to temperature and other conditions.The relative importance of these functions varies with the circumstances, as well as the species.</p>

                                    <p>All chameleons are primarily <span>insectivores</span> that feed by <span>ballistically projecting</span> their long <span>tongues</span> from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away. While the chameleons' tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies , smaller chameleons have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts. Thus, smaller chameleons are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger chameleons that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates, and can project their tongues more than twice their body length</p>
